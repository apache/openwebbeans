Apache OpenWebBeans README
-------------------------------

Welcome!

Thanks for downloading and using Apache OpenWebBeans (OWB).

This document is a "Getting Started Guide" for the latest Apache OpenWebBeans release.

--------------------------------
What is Apache OpenWebBeans?
--------------------------------
OpenWebBeans is an Apache License V 2.0 licensed implementation of the Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection 4.0 specification.

CDI-4.0 is mostly backward compatible to JSR-365 CDI-2.0, JSR-346 CDI-1.2 and JSR-299 CDI-1.0 but uses the jakarta.* package names instead of javax.*

Our project's web page can be found at:
https://openwebbeans.apache.org

The latest Java Version we support is Java-21.
The minimum Java Version is Java-11.


--------------------------------
OpenWebBeans Release Features
--------------------------------

- The latest OWB release supports the following features
-----------------------------------
* Managed Beans Support
* Producer Method Support
* Producer Field Support
* Java EE Resource Injection Support
* Inheritance, Stereotype Inheritances
* Specialization Support
* Event Support
* Decorator and Interceptor Support
* Lookup and Dependency Injection Support
* Java EE Plugin Support (via ServetContextListener interface)
* Portable Integration Support
* Passivation Capability of Beans
* @Alternative support
* OSGi environment support with an own plugable bundle ClassPath scanner
* plugable SecurityManager integration doubles speed if no SecurityManager is being used
* support for direct CDI usage in Tomcat and other Servlet environments


Noteable differences to CDI spec behaviour
--------------------------------------------

In a few special cases Apache OpenWebBeans might behave a little bit different than
other CDI implementations. This is to some degree caused by the JSR-299 spec being
not clear about some special topics so we needed to interpret the wording on our own.
This mainly concerns the area of section 5 and 12.1 Bean Archives (BDA) which doesn't work
out when it comes to OSGi containers and likes.
In Apache OpenWebBeans, a settings configured in a beans.xml file of a jar is not
only effective for this very bean archive but for the whole BeanManager in control
of the Application. This is especially the case for <alternatives>, <decorators> and
<interceptors>! An Alternative, Interceptor or Decorator enabled in one BDA is active
for the whole Application.

How to Configure OpenWebBeans
---------------------------------------------

This section explains a content of the distribution bundle, OWB plugins and its
dependent libraries.

---------------------------------------------
1.1.6 Distribution Content
---------------------------------------------
There are several jars in the OpenWebBeans 1.0.0 distribution;

 - openwebbeans-impl-1.1.6.jar     --> Includes Core Dependency Injection Service.
 - openwebbeans-ejb-1.1.6.jar      --> EJB Plugin(Supports EJBs in OpenEJB embedded in Tomcat).
 - openwebbeans-jms-1.1.6.jar      --> JMS Plugin(Supports injection of JMS related artifacts,i.e, ConnectionFactory, Session, Connection etc.)
 - openwebbeans-jsf-1.1.6.jar      --> JSF-2.0 Plugin(JSF Conversation Scoped Support).
 - openwebbeans-jsf12-1.1.6.jar    --> JSF-1.2 Plugin(JSF Conversation Scoped Support).
 - openwebbeans-resource-1.1.6.jar --> Java EE Resource Injection for Web Projects (Includes @PersistenceContext,@PersistenceUnit
                                          and @Resource injection into the Managed Beans. @Resource injections use java:/comp/env of the
                                          Web application component. @PersistenceContext is based on extended EntityManager.
 - openwebbeans-spi-1.1.6.jar      --> OpenWebBeans Server Provider Interfaces. They are implemented by runtime environments that would
                                          like to use OpenWebBeans as a JSR-299 implementation.
 - samples                            --> Includes source code of the samples. Samples are mavenized project  therefore you can easily build and run
                                          them from your environment that has maven runtime.
 - openwebbeans-osgi-1.1.6.jar     --> ClassPath ScannerService SPI implementation for OSGI environments like Apache Geronimo-3
 - openwebbeans-web-1.1.6.jar      --> Basic Servlet integration
 - openwebbeans-tomcat6-1.1.6.jar  --> Support for deeper integration into Apache Tomcat-6
 - openwebbeans-tomcat7-1.1.6.jar  --> Support for deeper integration into Apache Tomcat-7




------------------------------------------
How OWB Plugins Work
------------------------------------------

OpenWebBeans has been developed with a plugin architecture. The Core dependency injection service
is provided with openwebbeans-impl. If you need further service functionality,
you have to add respective plugin jars into the application classpath. OpenWebBeans
uses the Java SE 6.0 java.util.ServiceLoader mechanism to pickup plugins at runtime.
If you run under Java SE 5.0, an similar hand written implementation will be used.
Please do not confuse OWB plugins with portable Extensions! OWB plugins are for
internal use only whereas portable CDI Extensions will run on any JSR-299 container.

Current Plugins:
---------------------
Look at "1.1.6 Distribution Content" above.

------------------------------------------
Dependent Libraries
------------------------------------------

Third Party jars:
-----------------
They are necessary at runtime in the Core Implementation.

javassist : Version 3.12.0.GA
scannotation : Version 1.0.2 (if not running in an OSGi environment like Apache Geronimo-3)

Java EE APIs jars(Container Provider Libraries) :
-------------------------------------------------
Generally full Java EE servers provides these jars. But web containers like Tomcat or Jetty
do not contain some of them, such as JPA, JSF, Validation API etc. So, if you do not want to bundle
these libraries within your application classpath, you have to include these libraries in your
server common classpath.

jcdi-api (JSR-299 Specification API)
atinject-api (JSR-330 Specification API)
servlet-2.5 or servlet 3.0 (Servlet Specification API)
ejb-3.1 (EJB Specification API)
el-2.2 (Expression Langauge Specification API)
jsf-2.0 (Java Server Faces API)
jsr-250 (Annotation API)
interceptor-1.1 (Interceptor API)
jta-1.1 (Java Transaction API)
jsp.2.1 or jsp-2.2 (Java Server Pages API)
jpa-2.0 (Java Persistence API)
jaxws-2.1 or jaxws-2.2 (Java Web Service API)
jms-1.1 or jms-1.2 (Java Messaging Service API)
validation (Validation Specification)

Dependencies of OpenWebBeans Maven Modules&Plugins
--------------------------------------------------

openwebbeans-impl :
------------------
Third party        : javassist, scannotation, openwebbeans-spi
Container Provided : jcdi-api, at-inject, servlet, el, jsr-250, interceptor, jta, jsp, validation

openwebbeans-ejb:
-----------------
Third party        : openwebbeans-impl and its dependencies
Container Provided : OpenWebBeans EJB plugin is based on OpenEJB in Tomcat. Therefore, if you install OpenEJB
                     within Tomcat correctly, there is no need to add any additional libraries. Look at the
                     OpenEJB in Tomcat configuration section.

openwebbeans-jms:
-----------------
Third party        : openwebbeans-impl and its dependencies
Container Provided : jms

openwebbeans-jsf:
-----------------
Third party        : openwebbeans-impl and its dependencies
Container Provided : jsf

NOTE : We are trying to decrease dependent libraries of the our core, i.e, openwebbeans-impl.
At 1.1.6, dependent third party libraries will be decreased. We have a plan to create profile
plugins, therefore each profile plugin provides its own dependent libraries. For example, in
fully Java EE Profile Plugin, Transaction API is supported but this will not be the case
for Java Web Profile Plugin or Java SE Profile Plugin. Stay Tuned!

Currently, as you have seen above, openwebbeans-impl depends on some Java EE/Runtime
provided libraries (servlet, jsp, el etc). In the future, with OpenWebBeans profiling support,
openwebbeans-impl will not depend on any Java EE APIs. Those APIs will be provided
by OpenWebBeans profiles/plugins that openwebbeans-impl will be used. Therefore,
you will able to use OpenWebBeans in your own runtime environment easily by writing
your own plugins and contributing it to OpenWebBeans :)

------------------------------------------
Library Configuration
------------------------------------------
To run openwebbeans applications in the Java EE based application server,
you could add the JSR-299 API and JSR-330 API into the server common classpath, and
implementation, plugins and dependent jars into your "WEB-INF/lib" directory
of the Java EE Web Application.

In this release, we can not support the OpenWebBeans as an integrated
functionality of the Java EE Application Servers. So, you have to manage the
configuration of the OpenWebBeans within your application's "web.xml" file. A sample "web.xml"
file can be found in the "config" directory. To use EJB functionality, you also have to
add OWB specific interceptor into your EJB beans. Look at the EJB section of this readme
for further details.

---------------------------------------------
OpenWebBeans Properties File
---------------------------------------------
OpenWebBeans uses a default configuration file to configure some of its
properties. Default configuration files are embedded into OWB implementation
jar files. Instead of opening the jars file and changing configuration properties, simply add
an "openwebbeans.properties" file into a "META-INF/openwebbeans" folder of your application
classpath. This will override the values from the default configuration.
You can specify a property 'configuraion.ordinal' in this file to define the overlay order.
A properties file with higher 'configuration.ordinal' value will applied later and thus
have a higher precedence. If you don't specify a 'configuration.ordinal' a value of 100 is assumed;
This allows to have multiple openwebbeans.properties files e.g. a common one in an EAR lib
(with configuration.ordinal=100) and more specific ones for each WebApp in your EAR (with a
configuration.ordinal of e.g. 101).

Each plugin developer can provide their own SPI implementation class and own configuration values. If you would like
to use those implementation classes or configuration values, you have to override the default configuration file as explained
in the above paragraph, i.e, putting "openwebbeans.properties" file into "META-INF/openwebbeans" folder of your application.
It is recommended to use a 'configuration.ordinal' between 50 and 99 for custom SPI implementations.

Below are OpenWebBeans' default configuration properties from our openwebbeans-impl.jar file and our plugins such as
our OpenEJB plugin.

Override default value of ResourceInjectionService

---------------------------------------------
How to Run Samples
---------------------------------------------

In this release, there are several sample applications located in the "/samples" directory
of the distribution. You can run those samples via simple maven command.

1) "Guess Application" : Simple usage of the OWB + JSF.
It can be run in the jetty web container via maven jetty plugin from source.
Look at "Compile and Run Samples via Jetty&Tomcat Plugin" section.

2) "Hotel Reservation Application" : Show usage of JSF + JPA + OWB
It can be run in the jetty web container via maven jetty plugin from source.
Look at "Compile and Run Samples via Jetty&Tomcat Plugin" section.

3) "JMS Injection Sample" : Show JMS injections. JMS injection currently uses
   ConnectionFactory as JMS connection factory jndi name. You can change this
   via configuration file. Look above explanation for how to configure JMS jndi. Also,
   JMS injection requires to use of a JMS provider. Generally Java EE servers contains
   default JMS provider. It can be run on JBoss and Geronimo. It uses Queue with jndi_name = "queue/A".
   So you have to create a queue destination in your JMS provider with name "queue/A" to run example.
   If you want to change queue jndi name, then look at source and change it from "WEB-INF/beans.xml" file.

4) "Conversation Sample" : Shows usage of JSF conversations.
It can be run in the jetty web container via maven jetty plugin from source.
Look at "Compile and Run Samples via Jetty&Tomcat Plugin" section.

5) "JSF2 Sample" : Shows usage of JSF2 Ajax.
It can be run in the jetty web container via maven jetty plugin from source.
Look at "Compile and Run Samples via Jetty&Tomcat Plugin" section. It requires
to use JSF2 runtime.


6) "Standalone Sample" : Shows usage of OpenWebBeans in Standalone Swing Application.
Look at "OpenWebBeans in Java SE" section.

Configuring and Running the Applications:
--------------------------------------------
See section Compile and Run Samples via Tomcat Plugin.

--------------------------------------------
Maven Install and Package From the Source
--------------------------------------------

Maven Version : Apache Maven 3.2.1 or later

First you have to download the "source" version of the OpenWebBeans project that
contains the all source code of the OpenWebBeans.

To install the Maven artifacts of the project from the source, Maven must be installed
in your runtime. After Maven installation, just run the following command in the top level
directory that contains the main "pom.xml" :

> mvn clean install

This command will install all the Maven artifacts into your local Maven repository.

If you wish to package all artifacts of the project, just run the following command
in in the top level directory that contains the main "pom.xml" :

> mvn clean package

This command will package the project artifacts from the source and put these artifacts into the each modules
respective "target" directory.

-------------------------------------------
Compile and Run Samples via Tomcat&Jetty Plugin
-------------------------------------------
This section shows how to run samples in Jetty or OpenEJB Embedded Tomcat.

------------------------------------------
Samples Run within Jetty Plugin
------------------------------------------
You can compile and run "guess","jsf2","conversation-sample" and "reservation "samples via maven Jetty plugin.
Go to the source bundle "samples/" directory. In the "guess/" or "reservation/" directory, run
the following maven commands. It will start up maven Jetty container. It bundles all of the
required jars into the WEB-INF/lib folder. You are not required to add any jar to the classpath.

Samples : Guess and Reservation
------------------------------
Go to the source folder of projects and run

> mvn clean install -Pjetty
> mvn jetty:run -Pjetty

Guess URL               : http://localhost:8080/guess
Reservation URL         : http://localhost:8080/reservation

Samples : Conversation Sample and JSF2
-------------------------------------
Go to the source folder of projects and run

>mvn clean install
>mvn jetty:run

Conversation Sample URL : http://localhost:8080/conversation-sample
JSF2 Sample URL         : http://localhost:8080/jsf2sample

------------------------------------------
Samples Run within Tomcat Plugin
------------------------------------------
OpenEJB samples are run with Maven Tomcat Plugin.

Tomcat Plugin uses http://localhost:8080/manager application to deploy war file
into your embeddable EJB Tomcat container. There must be an tomcat-users.xml
file in the "conf" directory of the server that contains manager role and username.

>Start Tomcat server if not started
>mvn tomcat:deploy

Ejb Sample URL    : http://localhost:8080/ejb-sample
Ejb Telephone URL : http://localhost:8080/ejb-telephone

Example tomcat-users.xml file
------------------------------------------
<tomcat-users>
<role rolename="manager"/>
<user username="admin" password="" roles="manager"/>
</tomcat-users>

-----------------------------------------
Deploy JMS Sample
-----------------------------------------
Simple drops jms-sample.war file into your application deploy location.

JMS Sample Example URL        : Hit the url http://localhost:8080/jms-sample/sender.jsf for sending JMS messages
                                Hit the url http://localhost:8080/jms-sample/receiver.jsf for receiving JMS messages

-----------------------------------------
OpenWebBeans in Java SE
----------------------------------------
OpenWebBeans can be used in Java SE environments such as Java Swing
applications. A Standalone Sample is provided to show how to use OpenWebBeans
in Java SE.

Go to the source directory of the standalone sample:
>mvn clean package;
>cd target;
>jar -xvf standalone-sample.jar
>java -jar standalone-sample-1.1.6-SNAPSHOT.jar
